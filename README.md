## What is Lifetime Value, or LTV?
In mobile gaming, Lifetime Value (LTV) is a prediction of the profit margin a game developer will earn from an average user during the entire time they play their game. 

## Why is LTV important?
LTV is the KPI that takes all revenue factor into account, a company that focuses on LTV and consistently increases it over time will be successful.

By calculating LTV, you will be able to: 

*Estimate how much each acquired user will generate over time
*Calculate scale potential by identifying how much you can spend on user acquisition and still generate a profit 
*Understand when itâ€™s time to stop promoting a game without new features or changes
*Optimize revenue streams to increase profitability  
This data allows marketers to modify budgets and pinpoint exactly how much money they can afford to spend on user acquisition and still remain profitable.


## Objective and Goal:
We are a game company. We plan to predict LTV by analyzing the movements of our users in-game.
